Sending HTML and Json Data:
-> Inside app.get function we cn also write the object or passing json data in res.send but the best practice 
is that use res.json because it convert the null or undefined data also to json . strigify.

Difference between res.json() and res.send():

res.json():
Automatically sets the Content-Type header to application/json.

res.send():
If a string is passed, it sends it as plain text unless Content-Type is explicitly set.

Difference between res.send and res.status().send:

res.send(data):

If no status is set, it defaults to 200 OK.

res.status(code).send(data):

Sets an explicit HTTP status code before sending the response.
Useful for handling errors, success, or custom status codes.
